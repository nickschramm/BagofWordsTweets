@boztank @ray_ban and video editing
@ecoeltd2 @subhajitsaha0x @desoprotocol @k3tan0 @VitalikButerin a foundation is a single point of failure
"@HouseGOP no one’s buying a two party system is good for the people either, but here we are."
@HouseGOP retweeting yourself isn’t going to change the answer. we already talked about this for hours.
@HouseGOP b check youtube and the tweets again
@cdixon is this an affirmation?
@HouseGOP I’ve already answered that 2-3 times in front of congress. Check YouTube.
@felixsalmon @ashleyfeinberg Coming in with “delete the website” inspires openness

@jason_kint I really wish I could break through all the abstraction here and answer you but alas and woe
@ScottNover it doesn’t matter
@jason_kint wrong group chat or?

"@RMac18 “openly hate”

yes, let’s never revisit past decisions"
@timnitGebru @ekp @anildash @jamesrbuk i’m sure. and we certainly have seen what twitter does positive and negative… https://t.co/ThTIOSlOvu
@ekp @timnitGebru @anildash @jamesrbuk yes
@jamesrbuk amazing substantive comeback
@alexsalvinews @TuckerCarlson not defending a thing. holding up a mirror
@brianstelter @pbump and you all are selling hope?
@dhruv agree with both

@uselessthinking @iHadrami_ @trengriffin @garrytan no
@iHadrami_ @trengriffin @garrytan it’s consistently been the dysfunction of the company

@WakaFlocka it’s been on 99% for a decade now
@SBF_FTX @TomBrady @BillClinton @opmthebahamas ?
"@Beautyon_ Eh? Bitcoin makes it possible, as you point out in your replies below"
@Beautyon_ Yes. Exactly
@Beautyon_ You’re arguing my point here.
@JackPosobiec @MarkDice @bluesky No company ever could
@VonPlumps True. And I really hope it stays that way. I do believe we have regressed recently tho.
@Rand0mGuest2 @stephanlivera CEOs don’t matter in this space. Or maybe at all.

@bwinterrose @chrismessina @lsanger @theAkshEffect @nbashaw @Twitter And this
@chrismessina @lsanger @theAkshEffect @nbashaw @Twitter It’s being worked on. Or was.
@lsanger @theAkshEffect @nbashaw @Twitter It’s not easy. Keep in mind we are the only service that allows you to turn the algorithm off.
@Bob_Boyle_1662 @TunechiBtc @k3tan0 @VitalikButerin Exactly ✨
@D_Twitt3r @k3tan0 @VitalikButerin @bluesky Yes. Twitter doesn’t own it. So a new owner of Twitter wouldn’t matter… https://t.co/TX9kbRbEG4
@MikeMcDonald89 @VitalikButerin The idea? 11

@Beautyon_ I disagree. I believe it does need a protocol with bitcoin-like properties to create resilience against… https://t.co/m0u0aV7yH3
"@Beautyon_ right. bitcoin has a protocol that is resilient to corporate interests. social media does not. without that, it is a problem."
"@SGBarbour as a public company, twitter has always been ""for sale."" that's the real issue."
@heyalexfriedman @elonmusk no
"@pavtalk @seyitaylor agree.

and I wasn't pushed out. I left."
@vladtenev u thirsty?
@joshu 💯
@juli882 @NeilJacobs amen my son
@travelyInvestor @NeilJacobs no
@Erikcason @NeilJacobs not worth refuting the fact that it's a spiritual cult of psychopaths that don't care about anyone
"@NeilJacobs agree. i'm skeptical of any and all ""leadership,"" especially my own.

"@ayosogunro no kicking, I want to help fix it"
@ahlswedecollect @espiers No it wasn’t.
@waltisfrozen I do. But the output of what we are discussing is not the result of an elected system. The Fed is not elected.
"@JoyAnnReid Ok. You can continue with the binary thing, or we can discuss systemic change which calls out both parties."
@espiers You’re new here.  Hi.
@davidmweissman I’m sure your perception is true. Doesn’t discount that the broader system is damaged.
